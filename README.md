# Airlines-Frequent-Flyer-Membership-System

## Business Case
- You are a Data Analyst for Python Airlines.
- In return for customer loyalty, Python Airlines is rolling a new frequent-flyer program.
- You are asked to create a software prototype of membership system. As a prototype, you are not permitted to integrate with the production database which contains all historical customer and flight data.
- The prototype will determine the correct membership and rewards based on some data input by the user.

## How the Program will work
**The program will work the following way:**
- **Membership** with be based on four-tier system. Rewards will be based on membership tiers.
- **Annual Membership** will be based on meeting or exceeding minimums (in the current calendar year) for a certain metric or combination of metrics.
- **Lifetime Membership** will be based on meeting or exceeding lifetime minimums (cumulative totals) for a certain metric or combination of metrics.
- A customer with lifetime membership to a lower tier can still earn annual membership to a higher tier based on annual membership criteria.

## Membership Metrics
**Membership will be based on some combination of three metrics:**
- **Miles** The total number of miles a customer has flown with Python Airlines.
- **Segments** The total number of segments the customer has flown. A segment is a point- to-point flight between any two airports.
- **Dollars** The total amount of money (USD) the customer has spent with Python Airlines. Includes cost of tickets, seat upgrades, baggage fees, etc.

## Membership Tiers
